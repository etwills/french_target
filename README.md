# french_target
Code for a little game called target but using french words instead of english words

The idea of the game is that a nine letter word is chosen and from that word a letter is chosen. For example, accrocher and the letter e. Then the player needs to find as many words with four letters or higher that contain e and other letters in accrocher. So for example cher. 

My idea for this project was to create a little game that I could play on my phone to help me practice my french and learn new words. Therefore I would like to include some features like hints for hard new words, and a way to search the definition of a new word that I don't know.

In the python code here is the basic game that can be played in the terminal. When I have time I would like to add the extra features because I think it would be a nice way to expand my french vocabulary and consolidate the words I already know.
